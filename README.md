# MP-IndoCOVID19

## Introduction

Here is my mini-project about **Indonesian COVID-19 Cases** for practice data processing with Python language.

I get the data from the government public data in JSON format.
You can also get it from this [Website](https://data.covid19.go.id/).

## Data Processing

I am using **JupyterLab with Python language** for data processing and applying simple descriptive analysis.

In this part, we will know what happened with the COVID-19 cases in Indonesia by the number?

You can see the syntax here:

- [py_indonesian_covid19.ipynb](https://github.com/faisalydth/MP-IndoCOVID19/blob/main/py_indonesian_covid19.ipynb)
- [py_indonesian_covid19.pdf](https://github.com/faisalydth/MP-IndoCOVID19/blob/main/py_indonesian_covid19.pdf)

Then, I export the clean data of Indonesian COVID-19 Daily Cases which I have processed to table in CSV format.
This table is used to make a dashboard of the cases for the next step.

CSV File: [indonesian_covid19_daily_20211116_163027.csv](https://github.com/faisalydth/MP-IndoCOVID19/blob/main/indonesian_covid19_daily_20211116_163027.csv)

## Data Visualization

I am using Microsoft Power BI for data visualization in an attractive dashboard.

From the dashboard, we can view how much the number of cases in three categories: positive, recovered, and dead.
It also shows the cases in time series by the line chart.
The interesting part is, we know in what month there are many cases from the historical by the bar chart.

You can see the dashboard here:

## Closing

I hope this mini-project can be useful for our insight into this pandemic case in Indonesia.

I am open to your criticism and suggestions so that we can share more about data science.
